# TouchBoard Pro

This is the first commercial product I ever helped make. The latest release and source code are available at [TouchBoardSoftware/TouchBoard](https://github.com/TouchBoardSoftware/TouchBoard). I am providing my personal copy of of an older version here, for any who may find it useful.

## About TouchBoard

TouchBoard Pro is a cross-platform commercial desktop application I co-authored for people suffering from severe Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and other similar Repetitive Strain Injuries.

It is an on-screen keyboard and clipboard manager. The program presents users with customizable keys that can type anything from a single letter, to whole pages of content. It can even simulate the press of any key on a physical keyboard (such as tab, escape, arrow keys, and so on) allowing it to do more than just type text.

Users interact with TouchBoard almost entirely by hovering their mouse cursor over the controls they wish to activate instead of clicking on them, with some exceptions due to limitations in the tool kit we used.

It is written using the Java programming language and was originally released and sold as [Shareware](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/shareware). Today the program is officially Open Source [Freeware](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/freeware). It was originally available on a number of Freeware hosting sites, but now has been released on Github. I'm providing my personal copy of an older version (version 3.0) in this repository. As of this writing the latest TouchBoard version is [6.0](https://github.com/TouchBoardSoftware/TouchBoard/releases), which can be found this [repository](https://github.com/TouchBoardSoftware/TouchBoard).
